### Research

My research sits at the crossroads of learning-based and model-based methods. On one hand, I aim to optimise the efficacy of model-based methods using learning techniques. On the other hand, I work to ensure the reliability of learning-based methods through model-based approaches.

My core areas of interest include robotics, physical sciences, and life sciences. These fields offer a wealth of inductive biases that can enhance learning-based methods, especially in low-data environments.

Currently, I'm expanding my research horizons as a postdoctoral researcher at [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/), in collaboration with Prof. [Hossein Azizpour](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=t6CRgJsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Arne Elofsson](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=s3OCM3AAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm exploring the potential of learning-based methods in modelling molecular interactions. My areas of interest in this domain include protein-protein interactions, drug discovery, and protein folding. Despite the scarcity of data in this field, it boasts a rich supply of geometric and physical principles that can be used to enhance learning-based models.

Prior to my current role, I pursued my PhD at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden, in collaboration with Prof. [Petter Ã–gren](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=8Z3Z3YIAAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral research focused on crafting efficient and trustworthy AI solutions for critical robotic systems, using [behaviour trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)). This work underscored the importance of efficiency and safety while exploring the potential of learning-based methods to achieve these goals, all within a framework of model-based reliability.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/) in Troy, NY, USA, specialising in aerospace engineering.
